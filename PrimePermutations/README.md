# [Prime Permutations](http://projecteuler.net/problem=49)

The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.

What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?

## Notes

* A prime number is any number that is only wholly divisible by 1 or itself e.g. 3 can only be divided by 1 or 3
* (I had to look this up on account of I can't maths)

* We need to concatenate the numbers into ascending order, e.g. the example given above would be 148748178147
