# Create three implementations of a simple list data structure:
* A singly linked list
* A doubly linked list
* A list with no form of linking

#Each node has:

Metadata: e.g. link to next node (Metadata can contain anything that you need to make the list work)

Data: a string payload (Data contains only the string payload)

# Objectives:
A node can be added to the end of the list
Any node can be removed from the list
The list can be asked to return all the nodes' values as an array
The list can be searched for a payload, if found it returns the node that contains that payload
