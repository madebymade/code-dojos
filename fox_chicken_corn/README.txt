You're stood on a river bank with a fox, chicken and a sack of corn.

You have a boat.

You have to get the fox, chicken and corn to the other side of the river, but there's only room in the boat for you to carry one item.

If the fox is left alone with the chicken, the fox will eat the chicken.

If the chicken is left alone with the corn, the chicken will eat the corn.
