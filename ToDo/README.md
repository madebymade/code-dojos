# To Do List

We're going back to basics for this one.

In Ruby, TDD a todo list that meets the following specs:

## Phase 1

- the user can create new tasks
- each task has a title, description, status, created at and completion date
- tasks can be marked as 'Done'
- shows a list of all tasks
  - all uncompleted tasks are ordered by created at date
  - all completed tasks are listed below, ordered by completion date


## Phase 2

- allow the tasks to be reordered by dragging them
- multiple lists
