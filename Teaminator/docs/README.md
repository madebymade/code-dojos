#Code Dojo

The Made team is growing rapidly, such that an hour is no longer enough to give each of us a decent amount of time driving our Wednesday morning sessions.

Going forwards, traditional mob programming sessions and code dojos will have us split up into smaller teams and follow this format:

- Spend five or ten minutes on the brief for the dojo/problem
- Split into teams small enough that we can each have around ten minutes at our respective controls
- Tackle the dojo/problem as a team for forty minutes
- Regroup for the remainder of the hour and present our solutions so that we might discuss the pros and cons of each (assuming they're not exactly the same)

####So to help facilitate the above, today's mission is this:

##Teaminator

Create an app that does the following:

- takes a list of Twitter handles for each of the team members present
- randomly and evenly splits that list into smaller teams of no larger than five, so that each team member has at least eight minutes at the controls

- presents the results on a nice, shiny frontend, incorporating our Twitter avatars
