A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects.

For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4.

If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order.

The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

012   021   102   120   201   210

We need to get it to return the millionth lexicographic permutation of the below digits:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

(the answer being 2783915460)
