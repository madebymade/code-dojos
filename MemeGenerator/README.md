# Meme Generator

In Rails, and using ImageMagick, we are going to build an app that generates memes for us.

Within the assets directory are four meme templates:

- Success Kid
- Philosoraptor
- Fry (Not Sure If)
- Courage Wolf

We want this app to allow us to overlay those images with some witheringly hilarious text.


## Features

- a user can select one of the available templates
- a user can add two lines of text (top and bottom, using Impact font)
- once the form is submitted, their meme is generated and they're taken to a page where they must click a button to trigger the download of said image


### Stretch goals

- as a user inputs their text, a live preview shows an approximation of the generated image
