# Made Game Grid

- Create a 3x3 grid with boundaries all the way around it that the player avatar cannot cross.

- Each tile in the grid should be 32x32px, with the player avatar occupying one tile.

- The player avatar should be able to move in four directions (up, down, left, right) using the arrow keys.

- Do the above without using a game engine (i.e. no [Phaser.js](http://phaser.io), [Crafty.js](http://craftyjs.com) or [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/))

## If we ace the above

- Create a larger grid.
- Add obstacles.
- Add a "win" tile that triggers an end game event when the player reaches it.
